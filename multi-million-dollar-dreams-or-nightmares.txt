Something happened that led me to realise I must do something to address the
insanity in the way that people are responding to the financial changes afoot.
It was a moment with friends when I realised how easily perception flips from
constructive to destructive and how people are simply unaware of their potential
influence in what happens.

A muti-million dollar client of a friend wakes up every morning wondering if
this is the day he wil lose all his wealth. It is not the first time I come
across this phenomenon. I remember hearing that 70% of the wealthiest people of
Switzerland felt finanically insecure. And this was before last year's prominent
global changes in our financial systems. I don't think that money is his real
issue. If it were, what figure do you reckon would bring these individuals real
inner security?

I notice that despite my income being irregular since 2001 when I left the
corporate world, I have a deep sense of trust in my financial future. It has
enabled me to take larger risks than a lot of my contemparies and as a result I
am able to do the work I love. I rarely look for work, it seems to find me
instead. I notice that solutions come when one is in a certain mindset. And that
you can create an upward-spiral of events just as if you are in the wrong
mindset, the opposite can happen.

  I rarely look for work. It seems to find me instead

With the current changing markets, I have found a role that I feel called to
play: to help people navigate the uncertainties with a solid state of inner
security, accessing their intelligence and creativity in the moment, wherever
they are. Responding to what is happening from a place of power, assuming there
is a solution and acting boldly.

I did not always have this capacity but I have learnt to cultivate it.

So I am starting by launching a seminar. I decided to partner with `The Citi-Zen
Foundation <http://www.citi-zen-foundation.com>`_ as its founder - Andy is
committed to developing a robustness of character that I believe is essential
for the times ahead.

People who know me will be aware that I am an avid practitioner of `The Work of
Byron Katie <http://www.thework.com>`_. She is described by Time Magazine as 'a
spiritual innovator for the new millenium'. She is a very strong example of
someone who is able to respond intelligently to reality and her deceptively
simple process called "The Work' enables other people to do so. I highly recommend
it and will be incorporating The Work into the seminar. This, with Andy's
meditation structures will enable people to access a lazer-like clarity of
perception -- otherwise known as sanity :-) I was speaking with Carole Mckenzie
yesterday who described it simply as direct perception. I.e just seeing the bare
facts without adding the drama.

With the coaching tools we will be able to show people how to respond very
powerfuly to their reality. This will enable them to access the real source of
inner wealth.

I cannot express enough how much I believe that if we collectively learn to
respond without the baggage of our unclear mind, then we can achieve miracles
together. So let's start with us, and then work out ways to enable this to scale
up. Why not start with you? Do share any ideas you have about spreading and acting on
constructive visions. I think this is very important work as it aimed at the root
cause. We need to be practical and help each other to do so. Our future depends on it!

If you would like to join us for the 3-day Seminar you would be most welcome. I
truly believe that through the tools we offer and the time you invest in
learning them with us, you will leave no longer suffering the uncertainties like
many people are now doing, as you will know how to manifest what you intend. You
will become more attractive in the wholesome sense of the word, and be able to
enjoy how things unfold this year; you will be a source of power for others.

.. epigraph::

  "One of my most rewarding decisions in assessing my career path was deciding to
  see Sofia at Turn Up The Courage. The techniques used by Sofia allowed me to
  develop a personal vision, identifying what is important in my life and then
  transforming this into career roles. Sofia used her great communication skills
  to listen then transform my thoughts and ideas into set goals.

  I was able to confidently move forward in my search for a new career role -
  working with Sofia to identify new roles and promote my transferable skills –
  which has successfully led to new caeeer opportunities."

  Andrew Douglas, April 2009

.. epigraph::

  "...Well, Sofia plays a key part in making ECF what it is. Her clear, friendly,
  encouraging instructions helped us to take the plunge and try something new.
  Her direction gave me the confidence to actively contribute this year instead
  of being 'along for the ride'. I recommend her wholeheartedly - I only wish
  more conferences were chaired by such a supportive, intuitive, welcoming
  faciliator." Rachel Collinson

  "I quickly learned that Sofia is extremely insightful and has a natural gift
  for seeing where a person’s energy is. In our first session, Sofia helped me
  to realise that although I was clear on the impact I wanted to have, I was not
  happy with the role I had narrowly defined for myself based on my past
  experience in the accounting/finance field. Sofia helped me to see my past
  experience as a means of serving a career I could choose based on what would
  really be fulfilling for me. This opened up a whole new set of possibilities
  and led to me choosing a graduate program in change agency. I began the
  program two months ago and I could not be happier with my decision.

  In addition to all of Sofia’s knowledge and expertise, she is also very warm
  and caring. I simply cannot thank Sofia enough for the change she helped bring
  about in my life and I wholeheartedly recommend her services." Nicolette

Testimonials:


.. epigraph::

  "It took me a long time to find Sofia. In fact, I spent 3 months looking for a
  mentor/coach because the mixture of ingredients I was seeking in that person
  was complex.

  I met coaches with a focused corporate approach, coaches with little life
  experience and those from recruitment backgrounds. I was however not prepared
  to settle for second best and then I came across Sofia Bustamante.

  I had an initial phone call with Sofia – and knew I had found my coach. She
  had the full range of condiments I was looking for – she is extremely bright
  intellectually and practically, has high social and emotional intelligence, is
  well travelled and on the ball. Sofia is a professional who has had
  experience of many different working contexts and cultures. She is in tune
  with the real world and has worked with people from all walks of life. She is
  charismatic and inspiring, and strongly believes that it is possible to follow
  your ambitions and dreams, even if that has not been possible for whatever
  reasons in the past.

  Sofia has vision and is driven to make her contribution to a sustainable
  world. Her approach to the world is simultaneously down to earth,
  entrepreneurial, spiritual and holistic . She is reliable, inputs 110%, keeps
  her word and has shown enormous commitment to my cause. I can only but
  recommend her – a rare gem in the coaching world."

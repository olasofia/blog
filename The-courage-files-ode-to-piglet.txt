The Courage Files: Ode to Piglet
================================

Who would have thought that little Piglet in Winne the Pooh would be a symbol of
courage?

Benjamin Hoff wrote two beautiful books about the A.A. Milne characters. The
first was called "The Tao of Pooh". It takes Winne the Pooh and compares him to
the "uncarved block" in Taoist philisophy. Pooh just *is*. He meets life with
simplicity and a straightforward attitude. As a result he is able to be
sponteneous and is essentially happy. A teacher for all of us!

.. epigraph::

 'When you wake up in the morning, Pooh,' said Piglet at last, 'what's the
 first thing you say to yourself?' 'What's for breakfast?' said Pooh. 'What do
 you say, Piglet?' 'I say, I wonder what's going to happen exciting today?' said
 Piglet. Pooh nodded thoughtfully.'It's the same thing,' he said.

In the story of Winne the Pooh, we get to know Piglet as a jittery, 'Very Small
Animal'. He seems quite insignificant compared to the other characters -- an
endearing frightened little thing. In his second book, "The Te of Piglet"
Benjamin Hoff shows us how Piglet is actually the one who manages to go beyond
his fears and limitations. Instead of regretting his smallness, he manages to
*apply* it for others. He thus becomes a very different 'Very Small Animal'.

"Poem from Pooh to Piglet"
--------------------------

.. epigraph::

  Animal so shy and small,
  dreaming you were bold and tall.
  You hesitate, all sensitive,
  waiting for a chance to live.

  Time is swift, it races by. 
  Opportunities are born and die.
  Still you wait and will not try;
  a bird with wings who dares not rise and fly.

  But that 'you' you want to be,
  is not You and will never be.
  No one else will ever do 
  the special things that wait inside of you.

  You can be a guiding star,
  if you make the most of who you are.
  And the sensitivity, 
  that you are now ashamed to see,
  can be developed even more,
  so you can find the key to hidden doors
  to places no ones been before.

  And the pride you'll feel inside,
  is not the kind that makes you fall.
  It's the kind of pride that recognises,
  the biggness found in being small.

I first read this poem in 1993. It touched my heart and has lived inside me ever
since. 

The poem has a profound message in it. In Benjamin Hoff's words: " 'Te' means virtue and in the way of
Piglet, the first thing we need to do is to recognize and trust our own inner nature, and not lose sight of it. In each of us there is something "Special" and that we need to keep!"

  Courage is loud, bold and boisterous. It is also silent, shaky, and hyper-sensitive.

Many people do not quite realise what it is that
they bring to the world and spend years trying to be something that doesnt
touch on what they really are. It is as though they are blind to what everyone
else can see about them. We must make sure that we recognise and own our core
gifts that we are born with. This must be prioritised in our life.

The poem also describes a courage that often comes disguised by shaky knees and
a lot of dithering. When you are wondering whether to make a brave move, absorb
the wise words of Pooh and let your spirit be moved. Find in yourself the Te of
Piglet.

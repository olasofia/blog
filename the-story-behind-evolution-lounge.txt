What is Evolution Lounge?
-------------------------
It is a form of peer-coaching, guerilla-style taking place on Wednesdays in
various locations around London. Guerilla-style, because it happens in public
spaces, in the places that are more associated with stress and craziness rather
than sources of insight and answers. Because those are the kinds of experiences
that we want to transform.

It helps us to access the wisdom available from everyone present. It establishes
the collective as coach.

Being Your Own First Customer; How it Was Born
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It was 2003 and I was isolated, having recently moved to the industrial part of
Germany. I had just been on the 2003 `Pioneers Of Change
<www.pioneersofchange.net>`_ Summer School. I came back and sorely missed being
with others who sparked me. I missed that kind of community - of others who were
experimenting and searching.

I also wanted to find a way to get insights about my life more
quickly, using the very sources of stress rather than having to go to a desert
island or a retreat. :-) An idea began forming in my head. 

I brainstormed with my then business partner `Helga Brueggemann
<http://systemsiche-beratung-duesseldorf.de>`_. We came up with the idea of
peer-coaching with a very special twist.  What's more, it was to be carried
out in places of high stress; rush-hour chaos. Yes! We wanted to jump into the
eye of the volcano, as these kinds of places reflect the state of mind and
reality that people experience on a daily basis. And it is in these spaces that
The Evolution Lounge comes to life and can give you answers

  We even had to import noises into one of them so as to try to create a
  realistic amount of chaos. On one occasion a bunch of Hells Angels passed and
  I wished they had stayed - they would be the perfect oral backdrop.


It has since been run in some wacky places and we have demonstrated it at
conferences. We even had to import noises into one of them so as to try to
create a realistic amount of chaos. On one occasion a bunch of Hells Angels
passed and I wished they had stayed - they would have been the perfect oral
backdrop.

We ran it weekly for on year in Dusseldorf Airport. Helga has continued to run
it in Germany and is writing a book on her experiences with it since then.

The Twist, and The Blessing of the Elders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am also very heartened that some of my own 'elders' have given it their blessing.

Helga shared with `Otto Scharmer <http://www.ottoscharmer.com>`_, one of the
creators of the `U-Process <http://www.theoryu.com>`_ how we had been
implementing a form of `presencing <http://www.presencing.com>`_ in the
Evolution Lounge without realising it. She reported that he was duly impressed. You see, in the
Evolution Lounge we actually demonstrate and guide the collective into
presencing together. Many processes indicate that you need to cultivate
intutition but this process actually shows you how. The twist is that we do it
collectively in a very direct and explicit manner. From a state of 'presence',
you experience your environment and each other in a different and magical way.

The beauty of this collective presencing experience is that the collective can
now realistically be coach-facilitator. Direct perception and signalling of energetic states
during the exercise means that the group is tuned in to itself and can more accurately pinpoint
where and how to intervene in each person's case.

I invited `George Por <http://www.community-intelligence.com/node/78#George>`_
to try it out as he was in the process of leading an inquiry into the
similarities of The World Cafe and the U-Process. We ran it in the Tate Modern
in London and after his experience he encouraged me to think about cultivating a
community of practitioners of this method, along the lines of the `World Cafe
<http://www.theworldcafe.org>`_ community. He offered to be one of the stewards
of this process and I had one of those moments when it seems like I am being
called to somethign deeper. I was not ready to do it then but 1 year later, it
feels right to engage others in seeing where this can go!

Filming and Capturing it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I have had offers of support to capture the process as we run it. I really look
forward to this as it is quite difficult to explain a process like this in
words! By documenting it, the Cookbook of Social Technologies starts to come into being.

Open-Source Toolbox -- the Emergence of a Social Technology Cookbook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Which brings me to the next point. I will be writing about this a whole lot more
but essentially I believe that we need to help each other to become better at
moving forward in face-to-face situations - together. And so we need to share
more of the tools that can help us with that. I have been in an open
conversation with a number of individuals such as `Jeff Archambeault
<http://adkblueline.blogspot.com/2009/02/second-life-market-index.html>`_, `tav
<http://tav.espians.com>`_, `Mamading Ceesay
<http://evangineer.agoraworx.com/blog/entries.html>`_ and `Servane Mouzane
<http://ogunte.com>`_ about enabling more people to have these kinds of tools.
The ideas is that people have tangible experiences and then share how it worked
and the tools that they used. This way, our common set of tools evolves. The
evolution lounge is one tool that is being thrown in to the toolbox. Let us
evolve it and create different forms so that the open-source toolbox grows, and
there is a mass increase in capacity to collaborate better with each other.

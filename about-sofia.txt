:Abstract:

  Sofia is a community builder, career coach, social process facilitator, mediator and social technologist.

  She is also a latin dancer, carnival of change pioneer (someone who believes
  life can be lived as a carnival, that together change can be
  undertaken as a dance, and that we can dare to write our own futures), lover of The
  Work by Byron Katie, warrior of light, poet, general social misfit and monkey. 

  How do you sum up a person with a few words? The answer is -- you can't. One
  approach that you can take is to play with different mediums to communicate different
  angles on your persona. Then you can build up a 'rich picture' of yourself. Above is the description I use
  on the various social networking sites. I do have a CV buried somewhere that I
  (rarely) use. Generally, I use the S-Curves diagram and also a 'bio': a few paragraphs that
  I then customise for different audiences. One can also use art and crafts to
  go 3-D :-) I recommend using at least two methods. That way you can cater for
  different cognitive styles.

Whole Person S-Curve
--------------------

The diagram below has become a very useful way of communicating who I am and
where Turn up the Courage emerged from. I call this diagram a 'whole person
S-curve'. 'S-Curves' help to show when systems change - jump from one state to
another. The S-part indicates one system dying whilst another one is being born.
There is an overlap which is demonstrated by the 'S' overlapping. It is
difficult to describe in words! Hence the usefulness of the diagram. We can use
this idea to show how we as individuals evolve. We have different stages in our
life. Who better to describe this than ourselves? That is what S-curves are all
about. We can own our story. This then is complementary to a CV. After all, it
is artificial to think that we start contributing to the world only after we
graduate or at the start of our first job. For some people, that is the point at
which they stop contributing in any authentic way. Many square pegs try to fit
into a round whole and their CV reflects a history of misfit. The S-curve
enables people to recover their true contribution and express it with dignity.

   Whole-Person S-Curve: How Turn up the Courage Came To Be</div></div>

S-curves have become part of a toolbox for career coaching and I work with
clients to help them to produce their own. Essentially, S-Curves map a person
from age 0 to now. Feel free to have a good look. You should be able to see the
evolution of a human being and as I mention, this can be very powerful when
combined with a CV. I shall be writing more about this but this is a good point
to show an S-curve in action!


About Sofia and Turn up the Courage
-----------------------------------

Turn up the Courage represents the spirit of what I bring to the world.

Let us not forget, it is also just four words. As an expression, when people
hear it - they usually seem to understand it before I have begun to explain what
I actually do! I think this is because when I say it, it evokes for me a whole
world that is beyond those four words and they feel it. Somehow a world gets
transmiited. The words are just pointers to that world. 

What I actually do
------------------

* I work to strengthen the fabric of communiites. 
* I facilitate communities in coming up with their own solutions -- I help them
  to innovate
* I help them to be courageous in their intentions
* I work at different levels -- with networks, large groups, small groups and with individuals 
* I am on a mission to spread the tools that enable communities to do all of the
  above themselves 

I coined the term para-coach and para-facilitator. This is taken from the legal
profession: para legal work is what people who do not have professional
qualification in the law can do. If you apply this to coaching then you get para
coach and para facilitator. Everyone can be a para-coach to some extent. Hold
that thought a moment and picture this: The collective as coach. This is where
the tools I was referring to apply -- to enable many more people to coach each
other.


Me or We? A Swarm Collaboration Model
-------------------------------------

When I talk about Turn up the Courage I alternate between the word 'I' and 'We'.
Let me explain: most of the work I do involves working with others - usually a
small collective of people who espouse similar values and who run their own ventures.
This model of collaboration is similar to film production. When it happens, a
group of different independents are drawn together to produce something and then
when it is over they disperse. Minimal organisational overhead. I am hoping not
to have to create an organisation around Turn up the Courage. Let's see where it
goes. See `this <principles-of-confluence.html>`_ section for more about fluid collaboration models.


My Background
-------------

In organisations and networks, my strength is in building a collective
vision and tapping into the collective intelligence of the team or network to
turn that vision into reality. I have pioneered various techniques to help teams to do
this.

Working with individuals, I delight in showing people how to bring seemingly
disparate aspects of their career into alignment, each aspect contributing gems
towards their core offering. I have worked with directors, parents, teenagers
and executives. In all cases I will find commonality in the different stages
in their journey and enable them to put their finger on the connecting threads.
A light will go on as they see, often for the first time, the bigger picture of
their life path.

I have a Masters in Chemical Engineering from Imperial College, London. I
started my career at British Airways, where I moved from systems analysis and
project management to learning and facilitation. I then left BA to move more
fully into people and organisational development, and, after a number of small
roles across various industries, have run a business as a coach, facilitator and
change agent since 2005. I has a balance of analytical and intuitive skills
and experience, straddling engineering and business analysis, to personal and
team development

I am a change agent and have gone through my own journey towards the work that
reflects my core identity. I am living proof that a big change in career is not
only possible but worthwhile! I have created a life where my work is fully
aligned with my core purpose. You can see how my work evolves in line with my
own personal evolution. And that the journey continues. You can see how the
deeper motivation for my work is intricately linked to my earliest challenges.
Each part of my journey has contributed to achieving my deepest longing and my
business offering is based on this.
